guitarist and record producer. He was born in Halifax, West Yorkshire, and raised in Framlingham, Suffolk. <br/> <br/>

&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Sheeran's popularity abroad began in 2012. In the US, he made a guest appearance on Taylor Swift's fourth studio album, Red. <br/>
"The A Team" was nominated for Song of the Year at the 2013 Grammy Awards, where he performed the song with Elton John. <br/> <br/>
He spent much of 2013 opening for Swift's The Red Tour in North America dates. His second studio album, x (read as "multiply"),

Awards at the 2016 ceremony: Song of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance.

<br/> <br/> &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Sheeran's third album, (read as "divide"), was released in March 2017. The album debuted at number one in the UK, the US and other major markets.

		because of his written and recorded songs that bring nothing but "ahhhhw" and "huhu" feels. I so much love the way how he composes his songs, and my love for
		his genre makes me love him more. <3 I have influenced my family members and relatives, and good thing, we're all now <strong> Sheerios! </strong> Since I am an avid fan, I'll be seeing him on April 8, 2018 as he'll have a #DivideTourMnl concert!
